# LinkedIn Engagement Strategy: Get 10x More Comments and Shares

Want to know the secret to viral LinkedIn posts? It's not luck—it's strategic engagement. This guide reveals proven tactics to dramatically increase your post engagement.

## Understanding LinkedIn Engagement

### Why Engagement Matters
- Algorithm prioritizes engaged content
- Higher visibility = more opportunities
- Builds community and authority

### Engagement Hierarchy
1. Comments (highest value)
2. Shares with commentary

## 10 Proven Engagement Tactics

### 1. The Question Hook
Start with a question that demands response:
- "What's your biggest challenge with..."
- "Agree or disagree: [controversial statement]"
- "Which would you choose and why?"

**Example:**
"You have $10,000 to invest in your career. Do you:

Drop your answer below 👇"

### 5. The Personal Story
Share authentic experiences:
- Career failures and lessons
- Behind-the-scenes moments
